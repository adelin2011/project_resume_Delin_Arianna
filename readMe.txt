		This plugin creates a CSS animation for text. I used it on the headlines in the document.

Media Queries
	The first media query was min-width used on the article. This was so my name would get smaller as the page view became smaller. 

	The second media query was for the skills section. They were moving to the left of the page as it became larger. With the @media, they stay in the same spot. 

	The last media query was for the testimonials. As the page becomes larger than 931px, an additional color is added to the box.
